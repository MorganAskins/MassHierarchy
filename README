Goal is to determine if Watchman as a ~1kton liquid scintillator detector at the IMB
site is sensitive to the mass hierarchy scale.

Expected Li9 rate: Kamland Li9 * (mu_imb / mu_kam) * (<E>_imb / <E>_kam)**0.7 = 6.24 / day
<E>_imb = 165 GeV
<E>_kam = 219 GeV
mu_imb = 0.629 /s
mu_kam = 0.205 /s
Li9_kam = 2.48 /day
IMB Depth: 1434 m.w.e
